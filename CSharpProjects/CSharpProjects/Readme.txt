This is a text version of the game Towers of Hanoi.

OBJECTIVE:
The objective is to move the stack to the end of the board without
placing a larger unit over a smaller one, moving only one number at a 
time.

INSTRUCTIONS:
To play this game the player must input which stack they are moving 
the top unit from, and then press enter. The player will then be 
prompted to input the stack they wish to move the unit to. Input
the selection and then press enter. Continue making moves until all
four units are in Row C. This is the end of the game and the Player
wins!

Ver 1.0.1 Bugs
-The game will crash if the player inputs anything other than "A" "B" or "C"
-Still looking for a proper place in the code to add an error message when 
the player uses an illegal character. 
-Haven't yet found a method of clearing the board after each turn so that
the player does not get lost with a screen full of text.
